# TrainMap

The project can be accessed via this [link](https://okaykenji.github.io/TrainMap/).

The project displays the route maps of Metro North Railroad, Long Island Railroad and New Jersey Transit (commuter rail only). Clicking on station names will display all planned trains for the date you are accessing the website. Data based on the GTFS data provided by the respective entities. 

Not associated with any transit agency, I just like trains and coding.
